Data Science from Scratch
=========================

Here I uploaded the codes and examples that I used to learn data science. These are attachments to the book "Data Science from Scratch, the second edition" by Joel Grus.

This book is probabely the most complete source available to become a data scientist. If you learn the theoretical and practical materials in this book, you should be able to answer interview questions.
